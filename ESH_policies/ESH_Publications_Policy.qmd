## **ESH Publications Policy**

### **1. Purpose**

This policy outlines ESH’s approach to authorship, data sharing, and dissemination of outputs resulting from Hackathon activities. It aims to promote transparency, inclusivity, and recognition of all contributors.

### **2. Core Principles**

**a. Openness and Transparency**

-   All outputs from ESH events (e.g. code, datasets, preprints, manuscripts) should be made openly available.

-   We encourage use of open repositories (e.g. GitHub, Zenodo, OSF) and preprint servers (e.g. EcoEvoRxiv, bioRxiv).\

**b. Recognition of All Contributors**

-   ESH recognises the importance of inclusive authorship practices. All significant contributors—regardless of career stage—should be appropriately credited.

-   We encourage the **CRediT taxonomy** to specify individual contributions.

**c. Support for Early Career Researchers (ECRs)**

-   ESH commits to providing ECRs with prominent authorship roles (e.g. first or co-first authorship), where appropriate.

-   Mentoring and capacity-building are integral to our publication approach.

**d. Collaborative Authorship**

-   Projects developed during ESH events are typically co-produced by teams. Authorship should be based on contribution, not seniority.

-   Disputes over authorship are to be resolved collaboratively, with reference to ICMJE and COPE authorship guidelines.

**e. Encouragement of Non-traditional Outputs**

-   ESH supports outputs beyond traditional journal articles, including R packages, workflows, systematic maps, blog posts, and data visualisations.

### **3. Preprints and Journals**

-   We encourage rapid dissemination of findings via preprints.

-   When preparing manuscripts, we prefer submission to open access journals and those that support transparent peer review and reproducible research.

### **4. Data, Code, and Materials Sharing**

-   All outputs should, wherever possible, comply with FAIR principles: **Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable**.

-   Code should be open-source (e.g. GPL license) and hosted on collaborative platforms (e.g. GitHub).

-   Data should be documented clearly and, if ethically appropriate, made publicly available.\

### **5. Acknowledgement of ESH and Hackathon Support**

-   All publications and outputs should acknowledge ESH and the specific Hackathon in which the work was developed.

-   Example: “This work was initiated during the \[Year\] Evidence Synthesis Hackathon (ESH), supported by \[partners/funders\].”\

### **6. Authorship Disputes**

-   In case of disputes, a neutral committee of ESH advisors may be consulted.
